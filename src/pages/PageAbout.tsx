				The book notes on this site are from books I am reading. Some of
				them are direct quotes, some are my paraphrasing of the text,
				and some of them are my ideas that I came to based on concepts
				read in the books. If a note is a direct quotation, I put it in
				quotation marks, otherwise there are no quotation marks, but
				each note has a reference to the book and page number so that if
				you want, you can find the text that my notes are based on.

				The purpose of this site is not to sell anything or promote
				any particular books or authors, but for me to interact with the
				texts I am reading and express my ideas about the concepts I
				read as clearly as I can. I also post these quotes on social
				media for discussion with others.
