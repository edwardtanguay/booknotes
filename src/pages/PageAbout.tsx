				The book notes on this site are from books I am reading. Some of
				them are direct quotes, some are my paraphrasing of the text,
				and some of them are my ideas that I came to based on concepts
				read in the books. If a note is a direct quotation, I put it in
				quotation marks, otherwise there are no quotation marks, but
				each note has a reference to the book and page number so that if
				you want, you can find the text that my notes are based on.
			</p>
			<p>
				The purpose of this site is not to sell anything or promote any
				particular books or authors, but for me to interact with the
				texts I am reading and express my ideas about the concepts I
				read as clearly as I can. I also post these quotes on social
				media for discussion with others.
